Selectable Plugin for GwtQuery
==============================

This plugin is a gwt clone of the [JQuery-ui selectable plugin](http://jqueryui.com/demos/selectable/)

The Selectable plugin allows for elements to be selected by drawing a lasso with the mouse over the elements or by cliking on element. If you want to select non-contiguous element  just hold the Ctrl/Meta key.

For more information, please refer to this [page](http://code.google.com/p/gwtquery-plugins/wiki/SelectablePluginGettingStarted)

Examples can be found [here](http://gwtquery-plugins.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/selectable/demos/SelectableSample1/Sample1.html)
